1. Image Classification using CNNs

The folder image_classification_cnn contains the notebook for classifying images using the GTSRB dataset the baseline model uses the layers:
 - Convolution
 - Batch Normalization
 - ReLU
 - Max Pooling

 Above the baseline is utilized the spatial transformer layer used for increasing the accuracy of the network.
